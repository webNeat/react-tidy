## What is React Tidy?

**React Tidy** is a library of utility custom hooks. It's like [lodash](https://lodash.com/) for React hooks. The goal is to provide a collection of tiny hooks that solve common problems or make writing React components easier.

## Features

To keep the library **tidy**, all included hooks are:

- **Atomic**: only does **one thing** and does it well.
- **Independent**: does not depend on any external library/configuration/context to work. Just import and call it.
- **Typed**: can infer the type of its arguments and give the correct type in return.
- **Tested**: has meaningfull tests that cover all uses cases.
- **Documented**: has it's own README describing the arguments, return and giving a usage example.

## Installation

Install using `npm`

```
npm install react-tidy
```

Or using `yarn`

```
yarn add react-tidy
```

## List of Custom Hooks

- [useIsMounted](src/useIsMounted) Avoid using/updating state of unmounted components.
- [useInstance](src/useInstance) Create an instance of any class and make your component react to its changes.
- [usePrevious](src/usePrevious) Track previous values of a variable.
- [useRefresh](src/useRefresh) Rerender your React component whenever you want.
- [useStorage](src/useStorage) read and write items on browser storages the React way.

## Contributing

You can contribute to this library in many ways, including:

- **Reporting bugs**: Simply open an issue and describe the bug. Please include a code snippet to reproduce the bug, it really helps to solve the problem quickly.

- **Suggesting new hooks**: If you have a common use case that you think worth having its own hook, open an issue and we will discuss it. Do you already have an implementation for it? great, make a pull request and I will review it. Please make sure your code is consistent with the rest of the codebase and use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) to format your files.

Those are just examples, any issue or pull request is welcome :)
